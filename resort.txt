Hotel location is great if you want to have a long weekend as this hotel is very close to the airport.
As a platinum Marriott member, I appreciate how new and nice the hotel grounds and rooms were.
The hotel was beautiful and very clean.
Staff was friendly and helpful. 
Every room is ocean view and very new/modern. 
Pool was clean and pool restaurant was convenient.
The hotel facilities are a disaster and an accident waiting to happen in hotel.
The hotel is in a secluded area and it’s very difficult to get around.
The rooms are very noisy, the food is disgusting, the beach is filthy and the hotel staff is clueless.
No wifi outside the lobby, beach is full of sea weeds,administration is not caring enough and there are overcharges on everything.
